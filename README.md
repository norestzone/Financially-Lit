## Planning & Building
1. Inital project planning went well, however met many obstacles when building database. ERD needed to be restructed multiple times and wireframes needed adjustments to meet functionality requirements.
2. Ideally wanted to stub out all routes in the beginning, but found it was easier to add routes as functional features were added for testing purposes.
3. API Key had a slightly different implementation method which required multiple attempts.
4. User button feature(s) was the most time consuming of project tasks, had issues calling specific information from database.

## Final Thoughts
My final project was a great learning experience! I was able to review previous lessons and work to help build my P4, which was a great way to practice what I've learned. I'm satisfied with my finished product and know I can add to this as well as other assignments in the future.

My main takeway from this project is that I'm capable of coding and with more research and practice my skills will keep progressing!
